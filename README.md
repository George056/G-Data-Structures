## Description
This directory will contains various data structures that I have created. This is mostly for getting more experience. Though it does contain some things that are not part of the stl. I plan on making these well enough to be able to use them in future projects.

## Contains
Dynamic array (vector)   
Node   
Linked list   
Array   
Iterator
